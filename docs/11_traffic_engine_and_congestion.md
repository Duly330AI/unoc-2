# 11. Traffic Engine and Congestion

This document defines deterministic traffic simulation, GPON segment aggregation, congestion hysteresis, and realtime event contracts.

Stack context:
- Backend: Node.js services + Socket.io
- Frontend: React stores consuming deltas and snapshots

## 1. Engine Goals

MVP goals:
- deterministic periodic traffic generation
- hierarchical upstream aggregation
- stable congestion states without flicker
- delta emission with reconnect snapshot recovery

Non-goals (MVP):
- per-flow QoS and queue models
- latency simulation
- historical persistence as primary source-of-truth

## 2. Traffic Generation

## 2.1 Eligible Leaf Classes

Leaf generation applies to:
- `ONT`
- `BUSINESS_ONT`
- `AON_CPE`

Eligibility baseline:
- provisioned and effectively online
- upstream L3 viability must be true (status diagnostics gated)

## 2.2 Modes

- `variable`: deterministic pseudo-random factor per `(seed, device_id, tick_seq)`
- `percent`: fixed tariff ratio

Directionality:
- symmetric mode allowed
- asymmetric tariff mode supported (`max_up` and `max_down`)

## 2.3 Determinism

PRNG contract:
- stable seeded generator
- seed material includes `TRAFFIC_RANDOM_SEED`, `device_id`, `tick_seq`
- identical inputs produce identical series

## 3. Aggregation Model

## 3.1 Tick Flow

Per tick:
1. build immutable topology snapshot
2. generate leaf traffic
3. aggregate post-order toward upstream/core
4. compute utilization per relevant entity

Rules:
- offline leaves contribute zero
- aggregation order deterministic

## 3.2 ODF-as-Aggregator GPON Semantics

Current GPON abstraction:
- direct OLT<->ONT links are invalid
- OLT PON branch is modeled via passive aggregation (ODF as logical segment anchor)
- ONTs attached through the same ODF/segment share one segment capacity budget

Segment identity:
- deterministic key built from OLT PON reference + aggregator identity (ODF anchor)

Scope note:
- advanced splitter trees and multi-ODF-per-PON are deferred tracks

## 3.3 Capacity Semantics

Capacity precedence:
1. explicit profile/model capacity
2. class default
3. fallback policy

GPON baseline (if no override):
- downstream `2.5 Gbps`
- upstream `1.25 Gbps`

Utilization:
- `utilization = throughput / capacity`
- values over `100%` are retained (no clamping)
- missing/zero capacity -> `utilization = null` + warning log

## 4. Congestion Hysteresis

## 4.1 Thresholds

Device/link:
- enter at `>= 100%`
- clear at `<= 95%`

GPON segment:
- enter at `>= 95%`
- clear at `<= 85%`

## 4.2 State Machine

- `NORMAL -> CONGESTED` only when entering threshold
- `CONGESTED -> NORMAL` only when clearing threshold
- no event on steady state

## 5. Event Contracts

## 5.1 Congestion Events

- `segment.congestion.detected`
- `segment.congestion.cleared`

Example payload:

```json
{
  "event": "segment.congestion.detected",
  "segmentId": "olt-1::pon-1::odf-1",
  "oltId": "olt-1",
  "ponPortId": "pon-1",
  "utilization": 0.98,
  "tick": 12345
}
```

## 5.2 Metrics Delta Events

Primary periodic event:
- `deviceMetricsUpdated`

Rules:
- send changed items only
- include per-item version
- status/topology stabilization events precede metrics/congestion in same window

## 5.3 Snapshot Recovery

- `GET /api/metrics/snapshot` provides baseline replacement state
- on reconnect or `topo_version` gap, client replaces local baseline before new delta handling

## 6. Runtime Controls

Config keys:
- `TRAFFIC_ENABLED`
- `TRAFFIC_TICK_INTERVAL_MS`
- `STRICT_ONT_ONLINE_ONLY`
- `TRAFFIC_RANDOM_SEED`

Loop requirements:
- maintain target cadence
- account for tick processing time
- continue after recoverable errors
- graceful shutdown supported

Backpressure:
- collapse queued metric deltas to latest when buffers saturate

## 7. Resilience Rules

- tick exceptions logged/counted; engine continues
- negative generated values clamped to zero with warning
- no-leaf fast path allowed while keeping monotonic tick sequence

## 8. Observability

Metrics:
- `unoc_sim_tick_duration_seconds`
- `unoc_sim_changed_devices`
- `unoc_sim_active_leaves`
- `unoc_sim_skipped_ticks_total`

Health:
- `GET /api/sim/status` -> `{ enabled, interval_ms, last_tick_seq, running }`

Logs:
- tick start/end
- changed entity counts
- congestion transitions

## 9. Testing Baseline

Unit:
- deterministic PRNG output
- asymmetric tariff behavior
- GPON segment aggregation correctness (ODF-as-aggregator)
- hysteresis transitions

Integration:
- event emission only on transitions
- delta + snapshot reconciliation
- backpressure collapse behavior

## 10. Future Tracks

- first-class link metrics stream
- advanced queueing/latency models
- persisted historical analysis windows
- multi-ODF-per-PON support and richer passive tree modeling
