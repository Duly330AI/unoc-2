# UNOC v3 Architecture Overview

This document is the high-level architecture entry point and map to the detailed specifications in `/docs`.

## 1. System Intent

UNOC v3 is a deterministic network emulation and planning platform.

Primary goals:
- authoritative backend state
- deterministic provisioning/status/optical/traffic behavior
- realtime UI synchronization through event streams
- contract-first APIs and testable operations

## 2. Architecture Principles

- Full-stack TypeScript across backend and frontend
- Backend as single source-of-truth for topology and runtime state
- Deterministic computation and ordering rules
- Event-driven updates with explicit recovery paths
- Documentation and tests as enforceable contracts

## 3. Runtime Topology

Core runtime layers:
1. Client UI (React + React Flow + Zustand)
2. REST and Socket gateways (Express + Socket.io)
3. Domain services (provisioning, status, optical, traffic, container, ports)
4. Persistence layer (Prisma + SQLite/Postgres)
5. Operational tooling (test/perf harness, command playbook)

High-level data flow:
- client issues mutations via REST
- backend validates and persists
- domain recomputes derived state
- socket events publish deltas
- clients apply deltas or resync from snapshot on gaps

## 4. Technology Stack

Frontend:
- React
- Vite
- React Flow
- Zustand

Backend:
- Node.js
- Express
- Socket.io
- Prisma

Current backend composition:
- `server.ts`: process bootstrap, dependency wiring, remaining write orchestration, simulation loop orchestration
- `server/runtimeStatus.ts`: passability graph, diagnostics, runtime status evaluation, subscriber upstream viability
- `server/realtimeOutbox.ts`: realtime queueing, phase ordering, dedupe/coalescing policy
- `server/readModels.ts`: topology/device/link read-model mapping helpers
- `server/readRoutes.ts`: topology/device/link read endpoints
- `server/diagnosticRoutes.ts`: diagnostics, cockpit-read, health and metrics endpoints
- `server/linkService.ts`: link validation, `/31` orchestration, and batch-create workflow
- `server/sessionService.ts`: session lifecycle orchestration, VLAN-path validation, CGNAT mapping, tariff derivation, and expiry/failure handling
- `server/deviceMutationRoutes.ts`: base device create/update/delete mutations
- `server/deviceOpsRoutes.ts`: provisioning, override, and OLT VLAN-mapping mutations
- `server/linkMutationRoutes.ts`: link create/update/delete, batch, and override mutations
- `server/sessionRoutes.ts`: subscriber session create/list/update and forensics trace routes

Databases:
- SQLite (local/dev/test)
- PostgreSQL (production-capable path)

## 5. Domain Service Boundaries

Core service responsibilities:
- Device service: device lifecycle and hierarchy state
- Link service: link validation and mutation
- Provisioning service: dependency checks and idempotent realization
- Status service: effective status evaluation and propagation
- Optical service: path resolution and signal budget calculations
- Traffic service: deterministic tick metrics and congestion transitions
- Subscriber service: session lifecycle, service-status evaluation, BNG anchoring, and CGNAT/forensics contracts
- Ports/interfaces service: role summaries and occupancy contracts
- Catalog service: model defaults and fiber-type source-of-truth
- Event dispatcher: coalesced realtime emission and ordering guarantees

Current module ownership notes:
- Read-only topology/device/link APIs are separated from mutation-heavy flows.
- Runtime status/passability logic is shared across tick, diagnostics, and read-model generation.
- Realtime ordering/deduplication is isolated from route handlers to reduce contract drift.
- Link orchestration is separated from the link route module, reducing route/service coupling.
- Session/CGNAT/VLAN orchestration is separated from session/forensics route handlers.
- Device and link mutations are now separated into dedicated route modules.
- Session and forensics routes are now separated into a dedicated route module.
- Remaining write-heavy orchestration and simulation internals still live in `server.ts` and remain the next likely extraction boundary.

## 6. State and Contract Model

Authoritative state:
- persisted topology entities
- derived runtime fields (status/signal/metrics)

Contract surfaces:
- REST API (`/api/...`)
- Socket envelope/events
- deterministic error-code catalog

Version/recovery semantics:
- `topo_version` supports gap detection
- clients must resync topology/metrics snapshots when gaps are detected

## 7. Determinism and Ordering

Determinism expectations:
- stable role/type mapping
- stable path/segment selection tie-breakers
- stable API ordering for list responses
- deterministic simulation output for fixed seeds and inputs

Event ordering baseline:
1. topology/optical mutations
2. signal deltas
3. status deltas
4. metrics/congestion deltas

Current implementation note:
- Server-side flush ordering and dedupe now live in `server/realtimeOutbox.ts`; reconnect/version-gap recovery remains partly client-validated, not fully closed.

## 8. Observability and Operations

Operational pillars:
- structured logs for mutation/recompute/error paths
- metrics for simulation, cache behavior, conflict rates
- health/status endpoints for runtime components

Operational docs:
- command workflows and local runbooks in `14_commands_playbook.md`
- test/perf governance in `12_testing_and_performance_harness.md`

## 9. Documentation Map (Canonical Specs)

Core specification set:

Operational governance:
- `CONTRACT_DRIFT_CHECKLIST.md` (pre-merge contract consistency checklist)

Roadmap source-of-truth:
- `ROADMAP_V2.md` tracks implementation tasks, dependencies, and builder logs.

## 10. Deferred Tracks and Non-Goals

Deferred architecture tracks include:
- advanced physics/layout engine
- ring protection simulation
- extended multi-catalog/version negotiation
- large-scale optimization phases

These tracks are explicitly managed as deferred roadmap tasks and are not implicit MVP scope.

## 11. Cross-Document Contract

- `ROADMAP_V2.md`: operational implementation source-of-truth
- `13_api_reference.md`: external contract for APIs/events
- `12_testing_and_performance_harness.md`: contract enforcement strategy
- `14_commands_playbook.md`: executable command workflows
- `15_subscriber_IPAM_Services_BNG.md`: subscriber-service architecture extension
